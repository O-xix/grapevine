# GrapeVine – Conceptual Translation App (Class Project)

This repository contains the final report for **GrapeVine**, a conceptual product design project completed for **CSS 350 (Software Engineering)** at the University of Washington Bothell.  

## 📖 Project Overview
GrapeVine is a proposed cross-platform language translation application that integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **sentiment analysis** to capture cultural and regional nuances in real-time speech and text.  

The goal was to design a system capable of context-aware translations that go beyond word-for-word substitution, supporting dialects, slang, and emotional tone.  

## 📝 What This Repo Contains
- **Final Report (PDF):** Includes requirements analysis, high-level architecture, proposed features, market analysis, development lifecycle, and success metrics.  
- **Team Contributions:** Work was completed collaboratively as part of a 5-person team project.  

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Requirements gathering and technical writing  
- System and software architecture design  
- Product planning and lifecycle documentation  
- Application of NLP, ML, and sentiment analysis concepts  

## 📌 Note
This was a **conceptual class project** — no production code was developed. The focus is on **design, planning, and documentation**, showcasing technical communication and product design skills.
